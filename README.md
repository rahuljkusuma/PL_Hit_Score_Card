# PL_Hit_Score_Card

The main agenda behind this project is to generate a score for given customer based on their tradeline and enquiry data. In this project I had to generate 11 different scores, the sum of these 11 scores is known as PL Hit Score. These 11 different scores are derived from following important parameters of the customer's tradeline and enquiry data.
> 1) Loan enquiry count.
> 2) Vintage in bureau.
> 3) Credit card (all types of credit cards) performance or utilization.
> 4) Personal loan performance.
> 5) Total active tradelines.
> 6) Maximum delinquency in all the tradelines.
> 7) Location of the customer.
> 8) Vintage of personal loan.
> 9) Consumer loan performance.
> 10) Company category.
